            <p id="title">From Waiting Systems to Wearable Devices - Our Journey of Innovation</p>
            <p class="content" id="intro">
                Innovation requires constant exploration, iteration, and a willingness to pivot.
                Over the course of three weeks, our team went through a journey of brainstorming,
                pivoting, and refining our ideas. In this blog post, we will share the process
                of our journey and the final idea that we arrived at.

            <p class="subsection" id="week_7">Week 7: Brainstorming Ideas for Waiting Systems</p>
            <p class="content" id="week_7_content">
                Our initial idea was to create a waiting system for medical, government, and
                bank facilities. We wanted to tackle the problem of long waiting times, which
                can be a frustrating experience for everyone. We spent the first week
                brainstorming ideas and researching the existing waiting systems. After several
                rounds of ideation, we came up with a waiting system that used a digital queue
                to keep track of people's positions in the queue and provide them with an
                estimated waiting time through their phones. However, we quickly realized that
                this idea lacked an actual IoT component, which is a critical factor our project.

            <p class="subsection" id="week_8">Week 8: Pivoting to Wearable Devices</p>
            <p class="content" id="week_8_content">
                We shifted their focus towards creating a waiting system for fairs, amusement parks,
                and carnivals. We planned to incorporate an IoT component in the form of watches to
                track wait times for rides and attractions. However, we received feedback that this
                wasn't a viable solution as people tend to use their phones for these purposes instead.
                We then pivoted to a new idea â€“ creating a wearable device that can track young children
                in crowded places. We realized that this is a growing concern for parents, who want to ensure
                their children's safety in crowded places like fairs, amusement parks, and carnivals.

            <p class="subsection" id="week_9">Week 9: Researching and Refining the Idea</p>
            <p class="content" id="week_9_content">
                Once we settled on the new idea,we started researching in-depthto ensure that we had a
                clear understanding of the problem we were solving and that we had a well-defined
                product that could effectively solve the problem. Our research showed that young
                children are at high risk of getting lost or separated from their parents in crowded
                places, and this can be a stressful and traumatic experience for both the child and
                the parent.
            </p>
            <p class="content" id="week_9_content2">
                To create a product that could address this issue, we conducted extensive research on
                the market, the target audience, and the competition. We wanted to make sure that our
                product would stand out from the competition and be something that parents would find
                valuable and useful.We created customer journey maps and personas to better understand
                the needs and wants of our target audience, and we used this information to develop a
                value proposition that would resonate with them.
            </p>
            <p class="content" id="week_9_content3">
                After completing our research, we generated a comprehensive report that detailed our
                findings and provided a clear roadmap for the development of the product. We also
                created a presentation video that showcased the benefits of our product and explained
                how it works.
